Upon merging changes from branch (geofrey-branch), there were conflicting lines inside of ingredients.md 
due to another merger from branch (ibel-branch), Line 2 in both ingredients.md in both branches merged 
contained text of one burger ingredient. I was able resolve the conflict by ordering the burger ingredient 
by which comes first in a burger, lettuce coming first and beef second.Which resolved the conflicting merge requests.
